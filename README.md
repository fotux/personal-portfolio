### Personal Portfolio Website
https://fotux.github.io/personal-portfolio/

This website was built using JavaScript and Tailwind CSS.
To enable github pages streaming, all files were copied into the docs/ folder. As a result, the code is currently a bit messy — but functional. (Mobile layout is not yet configured.)

The site is intended to introduce myself and showcase the projects I’ve built.

🛠️ Please note that it’s still under development, and some features may not be fully functional yet.
